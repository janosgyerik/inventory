The images in the cells are not as cell values, but as background fill.

Copy-paste into other applications doesn't work, because the data pasted on the clipboard is in a format that doesn't make this possible. It's not any image format, but some sort of RTF. It can paste to other cells within Numbers, but not anywhere outside Numbers.

Maybe the clipboard content can be converted to a bitmap, but it seems this is not at all straightforward, if at all possible.

An alternative approach may be to extract the image content from the cell background fill, but couldn't find how to do that.
One idea is to figure out inserting a background fill, which may be easier to find on internet, and then the reverse of the operation may be easier to figure out too.

You can play with applescript using the Script Editor program. It's in Applications / Utilities.

A very useful command to show info about stuff on the clipboard:

    clipboard info

See the scratch scripts in this dir, and in `/Library/Scripts`.
